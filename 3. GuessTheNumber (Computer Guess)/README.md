# GUESS THE NUMBER (computer guess)

In this project "Guess The Number", user decides a number between some interval of number. Similarly, computer randomly chooses a number between certain interval of number.  Then, we check whether the number chose by computer is matched with user number. If so, user return feedback'c' and computer wins, otherwise user returns too low(l) or too high(h) and repeat the process until computer gets it correct. 

## Guess The Number - as a project

In this project, we will learn 
--> Python module "random"
--> Working of while loop and conditionals
--> Getting user input

## Guess The Number - includes

--> Import random and use random.randint(a,b) to let computer to choose a number
--> Apply while loop in order to iterate code if computer chose number is not matched with user
--> Use comditionals (if..else) to check whether the number chose by computer is matched, low or high

My code is attached above. Please refer to it.

### Enjoy coding!!
