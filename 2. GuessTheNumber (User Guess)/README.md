# GUESS THE NUMBER

In this project "Guess The Number", computer randomly chooses a number between certain interval of number. Similarly, user input a number between same interval of number as computer. Then, we check whether the number given by user is matched with computer. If so, user wins otherwise print low or high comparing the user input and computer random number. 

## Guess The Number - as a project

In this project, we will learn <br>
--> Python module "random"<br>
--> Working of while loop and conditionals<br>
--> Getting user input

## Guess The Number - includes

--> Import random and use random.randint(a,b) to let computer to choose a number<br>
--> Apply while loop in order to iterate code if user entered number is not matched with computer<br>
--> Use comditionals (if..else) to check whether the number given by user is matched, low or high

My code is attached above. Please refer to it.

### Enjoy coding!!
